# Data Analysis – Raw Documentation

This file documents the raw steps, decisions, challenges, and fixes applied while working on the Amazon sales dataset.  
The goal is to maintain full transparency of the analytical workflow, from raw data ingestion to analysis-ready data.

## 1. Dataset Overview

- Source: Kaggle (Amazon Sales Data)
- Total rows: 128,975
- Total columns: 23
- Domain: E-commerce / Sales Analytics

The dataset includes order details, fulfillment information, product attributes, shipment data, and revenue-related fields.

---

## 2. Initial Data Ingestion

The dataset was loaded into **Excel Power Query** to perform initial cleaning and transformation.  
Power Query was chosen to ensure:
- Reproducibility of transformations
- Scalability for large datasets
- Clear documentation of data cleaning steps

---

## 3. Column Review & Type Correction

Each column was reviewed individually and converted to its appropriate data type based on business meaning:
- Text fields: product details, identifiers, location attributes
- Numeric fields: quantity, amount
- Boolean fields: B2B flag, holiday indicator
- Date fields: order date

Most columns were corrected using standard Power Query transformations.

## 4. Date Column Issue

### Problem
The `Date` column was originally stored as **text** in the format **MM-DD-YY**.  
Direct conversion to a date type resulted in errors due to locale interpretation limitations in the Excel version being used.

---

### Resolution
A custom column was created to explicitly parse the text-based date:

```m
= try Date.FromText([Date], "en-US") otherwise null

## 9. Loading Data into PostgreSQL

After completing all transformations in Power Query, the cleaned dataset was converted into an **Excel Table** to preserve schema consistency and structured formatting.

The Excel table was then loaded into **PostgreSQL** using the **Import/Export Data** feature. This approach ensured:
- Accurate column-to-type mapping
- Preservation of cleaned date and numeric fields
- Efficient transfer of a large dataset (128,975 rows)

During the import process:
- Appropriate SQL data types were assigned (TEXT, INTEGER, BOOLEAN, DATE)
- Long or variable-length text fields were stored using TEXT
- Numeric and date fields were validated post-import

---

## 10. Post-Load Validation in SQL

After loading the table into PostgreSQL, basic validation checks were performed to confirm data integrity:
- Row count verification against the source dataset
- Date range validation to ensure correct parsing
- Null checks on critical analytical columns (date, amount, quantity)

The table was then deemed analysis-ready and used for SQL-based revenue trends, growth analysis, and downstream Python analytics.
