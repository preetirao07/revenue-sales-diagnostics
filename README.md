# revenue-sales-diagnostics
End-to-end revenue diagnostics using SQL &amp; Python to analyze trends, growth, and business drivers in an e-commerce/SaaS context.


The project focuses on answering a core business question:
  **Why did revenue change over time?**
Using SQL and Python, the analysis explores revenue trends, growth metrics, seasonality, and volatility, and converts findings into actionable business insights.
